<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today I'm going to teach you how to make an authentic lasagna as if I were an Italian nonna from the 20th century. That is to say, without skimping on time, love or quality of the ingredients. </p>
    <p>I invite you to see how it's done and prepare it yourselves. Give it a shot!</p>

            <li>1 celery branch</li>
            <li>800 g peeled tomatoes, or tomato sauce</li>
            <li>50 ml milk</li>

            <li>salt (to taste)</li>

            <li>200 g common flour</li>
            <li>2 big eggs</li>
            <li>1-2 tbs olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>For the bechamel</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>80 g butter</li>
            <li>80 g common flour</li>
            <li>750 ml milk <strong>(cold)</strong></li>
            <li>nutmeg to taste</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>200 g grated parmesan</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the bacon, the onion, the carrots and the celery branch into small squares.</li>
            <li>Put the bacon in a pan over medium heat. Don't forget to stir it from time to time!</li>
            <li>Add a splash of oil, the cut vegetables and a pich of salt to the pan.</li>
            <li>Change to medium low heat and cook until the onion, the carrot and the celery soften.</li>
            <li>Add the beef. Stir until it changes color.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes or the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce begins to boil, change the heat level to low. Then place the lid over the pan, but leave a gap for the steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Let cook for <strong>2-4 hours</strong> (if you notice that the sauce is getting dry, add some more water or broth).</li>
            <li>Season to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the milk to balance the acidity.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>For the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt, the eggs, and a splash of oil. Stir very well.</li>
            <li>Finish making the dough ball with your hand. Keep in mind this dough shouldn't be kneaded much. Just integrate all its ingredients well.</li>
            <li>Cover and leave to rest for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stretch the dough with a rolling pin. The ideal dough thickness is when it becomes a bit transparent.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough in sheets size 10x12 cm. Approximately 17 sheets will come out.</li>
            <li>Cook the dough in plenty of salted water for about 1 minute. Ideally in 2 batches so that the sheets don't stick together.</li>
            <li>Rinse with cold water and place a cloth on it to dry.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>For the bechamel</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter.</li>
            <li>Add the flour. Sauté for 2-3 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>cold</strong> milk and switch to high heat (it is important that the milk is cold because flour dissolves very well in it).</li>
            <li>Stir until thick.</li>
            <li>As soon as it starts to boil, switch to medium heat and cook it for 2-3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Once removed from the heat, add salt, ground black pepper and nutmeg to taste.</li>
            <li>Cover it with plastic wrap or similar to prevent the formation of a crust.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Now that you have your filling, your dough and your bechamel ready, it's time to assemble your lasagna!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºc with heat from above and below.</li>
            <li>Grease the mold with the butter.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom with a layer of bechamel.</li>
            <li>Now repeat this layer process until the mold is filled:
                <ol>
                    <li>dough</li>
                    <li>filling</li>
                    <li>bechamel</li>
                    <li>Parmesan</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Generously cover the last layer with bechamel and sprinkle with Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes, the last 5 on the grill at 250ºc.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
