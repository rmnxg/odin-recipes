<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Argentine locro is a dish made from white corn, beans and squash or pumpkin. It requires prolonged cooking, which is why it allows you to use tough cuts of meat such as brisket and allows different versions by varying the ingredients.</p>
<p>It has its origins in the time of the Spanish colonization of America and a rich tradition that reflects the fusion of both cultures. Due to its history and what it represents, it became a typical meal of Argentina's national holidays.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Stew</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Soak the white beans and white corn 24 hours before preparing the stew (store in a container with water in the refrigerator).</li>
    <li>Cut all the ingredients into cubes (for the pumpkin/squash: cut one half into cubes and grate the other half).</li>
    <li>Cook the white corn in a saucepan along with the white beans and the pumpkin with 2 liters of water. Stir with a wooden spoon every 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>After an hour of cooking, add the meats. Stir.â€‹</li>
    <li>Let cook for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Serve while it's very hot.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Spicy sauce</h3>
    <li>Pour the oil into a pot.</li>
    <li>Pour the chopped green onion into the pot at a low temperature. The idea is that it cooks slowly and is not crunchy.</li>

    <li>Cook 5 more minutes and remove.</li>
    <li>Serve in a separate container to add to taste.</li>
